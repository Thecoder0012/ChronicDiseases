# Medical Patients
## A website for doctors trying to online diagnose patients who may have chronic diseases! As a patient, you will have to take the questionaire test on the site. When taking the test, you will have to answer some questions, and the algorithm will then tell you what chronic disease you may have. After the questionaire, you will be asked if you have additional comments, and the doctor will then review it.
